 <h1>ABOUT SWEETS SHOP</h1>
 <p><span>The Sweets Shop was founded in New York by two college classmates during<br>
    the summer of 2020.This shop first began on a small business page on the Instagram<br>
    social media platform ran by the founders themselves at the time. As the business grew<br>
    bigger and bigger, the founder decided to open up her own local shop, in where the<br>
    clientele that she was able to obtain from the social media page, can come in to<br>
    buy and eat their sweets, as well as new clients.</span></p>
